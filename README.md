# Golden_Test

## Overview

`Golden_Test` is a testing framework designed for evaluating a **Punctuation model** using the concept of golden tests. Golden testing involves comparing the current output of a system against a pre-approved "golden" output to detect unintended changes or regressions. This repository provides scripts and data to perform such validation on punctuation models, ensuring their outputs remain consistent and accurate over time.

## Repository Contents

- `tester.py` — Main testing script that runs the golden tests against the punctuation model.
- `matrix.py` — Utility module, likely for handling confusion matrices or evaluation metrics.
- `favorable_cases.txt` — Text file containing sample cases that represent ideal or expected outputs for testing.

## What Are Golden Tests?

Golden tests (also known as characterization or snapshot tests) compare the output of a program to a stored "golden" output. If the output changes unexpectedly, the test fails, signaling a potential issue. This approach is especially useful for complex outputs where writing explicit assertions is difficult.

## Usage

1. Prepare your punctuation model so that it can be tested by `tester.py`.
2. Run the tester script to compare the model’s output against the golden data:

```bash
python tester.py
```

3. Review the results and any discrepancies reported.

4. Update the golden outputs if changes are intentional and verified.

## Benefits of Golden Testing for Punctuation Models

- **Detects regressions:** Ensures that changes to the model do not degrade punctuation accuracy.
- **Maintains consistency:** Keeps outputs stable across model versions.
- **Simplifies validation:** Avoids writing complex assertions by comparing outputs directly.
